<b>An <font color = "blue">online judge</font> is an online system to test programs in <font color = "blue">programming contests</font> .They are also used to practice for such contests. Many of these systems organize their own contests. The system can compile and execute <font color = "brown">code</font>, and test them with pre-constructed data.Submitted code may be run with restrictions, including time limit, memory limit, security restriction and so on. The output of the code will be captured by the system, and compared with the standard output. The system will then return the result. When mistakes were found in a standard output, rejudgement using the same method must be made. Online Judges have <font color = "red">ranklists</font> showing users with the biggest number of <font color = "green">accepted</font> solutions and shortest execution time for a particular problem.<br>
